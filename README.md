My application idea is a Lost pets Board. It would be used by people wanting help finding their lost pets. They simply post their 
pets information and then others with access to S3 can go in and view all lost pets.

My web application provides 3 features/servies. The first feature is a location finder: A user hits the show my location button which asks for location access and then grabs the longitute and latitute of the person.
It also provides a link to a map of that location

The second feature is the page that allows users to upload their picture of their pet as well as the pets information

The third feature is an email service that can be used to recieve updates on lost pets in your area or to send emails out about your pet.
